# Degree 53 ES6 ESLint Config

This config is dependent on `eslint` and `babel-eslint` being installed to your `./node_modules` at the same level as your `.eslintrc.js` file.

In your project `eslintrc.js` file:

``` javascript
{
	"extends": [
		"degree53-es6"
	]
}
```

For an explanation of the rules please see the [ESLint documentation](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/).
